# Zombie-Game
Zombie Survival Game made in PyGame

This is a very straight-forward zombie survival game that is currently in developmental stages.The idea was originally created by Albert Lo and team members include Chris Quinones(Co-Programmer), and Doug Wu (Sprite Artist). This game is developed in PyGame and will run if you download all the files in the repository and run it with a Python compiler that has PyGame installed. We will convert the game to an executable when it is ready for release and probably host it on some site and generate some statistics about how many people have played the game. Please report any bugs you may notice to lohoi@umich.edu. Hope you have fun :)!
